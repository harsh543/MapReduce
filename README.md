# Apache Hadoop MapReduce project

The code has test coverage line number and test function as input shown in Input.txt file.
Then a mapreduce java program maps the input(test function name,line number covered) to (line numbers,test function)So it tells what all lines numbers were covered with the test functions.

Deployed it on Hortonworks Apache hadoop sandbox and got output.
Then deployed it on Amazon EMR and put the jar file and executed by step
